              measuring by how well each asset is coordinated around clear
              results for children. Striving to have these best practices become
              common practice, Promise Neighborhoods are quickly becoming the
              region’s premier vehicle for achieving neighborhood
              transformation, one child at a time. Allentown Promise
              Neighborhood is the first and oldest Promise Neighborhood located
              in the fastest growing region of Pennsylvania. The City of
              Allentown is the region’s largest city. Covering 9 blocks of
              Allentown’s “Old Allentown Historic District,” is where you’ll
              find a culturally rich and economically diverse place—Allentown
              Promise Neighborhood.
